Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.

Problem Statement Scenario:
Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers. Mercedes-Benz is the leader in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.

To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.

You are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.
Following actions should be performed:

1)If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then you need to remove those variable(s).

2)Check for null and unique values for test and train sets.

3)Apply label encoder.

4)Perform dimensionality reduction.

5)Predict your test_df values using XGBoost.




# What is Data Science?
### Let us begin our learning on Data Science with Python by first understanding of data science. Data science is all about finding and exploring data in the real world and using that knowledge to solve business problems. Some examples of data science are:

    #### Customer Prediction - System can be trained based on customer behavior patterns to predict the likelihood of a customer buying a product
    #### Service Planning - Restaurants can predict how many customers will visit on the weekend and plan their food inventory to handle the demand 

## 6.1. Focus – What are the key features that your language highlights? When developers choose this language over other languages, what are the typical reasons?. 
### Python as a programming language has become very popular in recent times. It has been used in data science, IoT, AI, and other technologies, which has added to its popularity. 

### Python is used as a programming language for data science because it contains costly tools from a mathematical or statistical perspective. It is one of the significant reasons why data scientists around the world use Python. If you track the trends over the past few years, you will notice that Python has become the programming language of choice, particularly for data science.

### There are several other reasons why Python is one of the most used programming languages for data science, including:

    #### Speed - Python is relatively faster than other programming languages
    #### Availability - There are a significant number of packages available that other users have developed, which can be reused 
    #### Design goal - The syntax roles in Python are intuitive and easy to understand, thereby helping in building applications with a readable codebase

## Python Libraries for Data Analysis
### Python is a simple programming language to learn, and there is some basic stuff that you can do with it, like adding, printing statements, and so on. However, if you want to perform data analysis, you need to import specific libraries. Some examples include:

#### Pandas - Used for structured data operations
#### NumPy - A powerful library that helps you create n-dimensional arrays 
#### SciPy - Provides scientific capabilities, like linear algebra and Fourier transform
#### Matplotlib - Primarily used for visualization purposes
#### Scikit-learn - Used to perform all machine learning activities 
#### In addition to these, there are other libraries as well, like:

#### Networks & I graph
#### TensorFlow
#### BeautifulSoup 
#### OS
#### Let’s now take a look at some of the most important Python libraries in detail:

### SciPy
#### As the name suggests, it is a scientific library that includes some special functions:

#### It currently supports special functions, integration, ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, gradient optimization, and others
#### It has fully-featured versions of the linear algebra modules
#### It is built on top of NumPy

### NumPy
#### NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains:

#### Powerful N-dimensional array objects
#### Tools for integrating C/C++, and Fortran code
#### It has useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

### Pandas
#### Pandas is used for structured data operations and manipulations.

#### The most useful data analysis library in Python
#### Instrumental in increasing the use of Python in the data science community
#### Used extensively for data mugging and preparation

6.2. History – What other languages were influential in the design and development of your language? Or has your language been influential in the design of other languages? In what ways?

6.3. Compilation – Is your language interpreted? Compiled? Does it compile to an intermediate language that requires a virtual machine?

6.4. Paradigm – what is the main paradigm of your language? Is it primarily OOP? FP? Something else? Is it multi-paradigm?

6.5. Syntax – Describe the basic syntax of your language. What does HelloWorld look like in your language? How do you write conditions, loops, functions,

6.6. Type system – Is your language statically or dynamically typed? Weakly or loosely typed? Does it feature Type classes? Does it have dedicated syntax for any Algebraic Data Types?

6.7. Data mutability – Does your language have any specific features regarding data mutability?

6.8. Functions – Does your language feature first-class functions? Closures? Currying? Does it have specific ways to deal with impure functions?

6.9. Classes/Objects - Does your language have OOP capabilities? How do you create classes? Objects? Interfaces? Does your language allow traits/extensions to classes? Does it support generic classes? How does polymorphism get implemented in your language?
